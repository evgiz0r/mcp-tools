# mcp_tools

A small repository scaffold for `mcp_tools`.

This repository is intended as a starting point — README, .gitignore and LICENSE are included.

## Next steps
- Create the remote GitHub repo (I can do this for you if you provide access or authenticate `gh`).
- Push the initial commit to the remote.
